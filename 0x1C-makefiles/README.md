# Makefiles

A Makefile is a text file used with the make utility to automate repetitive tasks, typically in software development. It defines a set of rules that specify how to build certain targets (usually executable files or libraries) from their dependencies (source code files, header files, etc.). Here's a breakdown:

## Components

- Targets: The desired output, like an executable file.
- Dependencies: Files needed to create the target, like source code files.
- Recipes: Commands executed to create the target from its dependencies.

## Benefits

- Efficiency: Only rebuilds what's necessary based on file modifications.
- Automation: Reduces manual work and potential errors.
- Reproducibility: Ensures consistent build process across different environments.
